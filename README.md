# Sheetarr

A simplistic python script to use a google sheet as an automated user requests tracker for your sonarr/radarr instances

Each user has their own sheet and can write in series or movies they want, and the script will add those to sonarr/radarr, and pull back important information such as if it is downloaded, how many episodes are on, the file sizes.

As well as being able to change the resolution, and seeing hyperlinks directly to sonarr/radarr for the series/movie.
